Download and execute the correct binary from below
- [Linux or WSL](https://github.com/Christopher-Tan/CyberFinalProject/raw/main/code/challenge-Linux)
- [macOS](https://github.com/Christopher-Tan/CyberFinalProject/raw/main/code/challenge-macOS)

1. Find the flag (hint: write a program that would brute force different buffer lengths).
2. Submit the code that you used to solve the problem, if it is bash command include it in a .sh or .txt file.

If neither of the binaries above work (for macOS we only had access to an M1 device, and for Linux we've only tested Ubuntu and WSL; different OS versions could also fail to compile) compile using "git clone https://github.com/Christopher-Tan/CyberFinalProject.git; cd CyberFinalProject/code; make challenge" then use "./challenge" to run the program.
