#### Prior to 5/19:
	Christopher- Research and created a vulnerable proof of concept.
	Matthew- Worked on research, planning, and slide
#### 5/19:
	Christopher- Researched c stack memory and heap memory structure.
#### 5/20:
	Christopher- Learned about c stack memory: EIP, ESP, and EBP, and git. Started working on creating a challenge program.

#### 5/25:
	Christopher- Worked on slides
	Matthew - Learned more about buffer overflow and will add on presenation. Learned how to use branches.
#### 5/26:
	Christopher- Worked on challenge, it is working correctly.
	Matthew - Wrote about Stack based buffer overflows and how to attack them in own branch
#### 5/27:
	Christopher- Worked on homework, we plan to explain how buffer overflow attacks have become less common over the years, and system protections against them.
	Matthew- Tested out the challenge code, more plans for presentation: how to brute force/code for challenge, buffer overflow in modern day, future of buffer overflow?
#### 5/28:
	Christopher- Merged branches, worked on completing extraneous documentation and fixing OS code compilation problems.
#### 5/29:
	Matthew- Worked on presentation on how to counter/recognize buffer overflow.
#### 5/30:
	Christopher- Continued working on presentation
	Matthew- Worked on presentation on stack based buffer overflow
